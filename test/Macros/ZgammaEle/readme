How to use:
(A)Run on MC (Event Yield):
   (1) Modify Input_table_Sig, the format is:
   ProcessTag   input_file_name  cross-section(pb) (NLO)  #total_unskimmed_event

   ps. ProcessTag:
     Zg    Zgamma sample
     ZJet  Z+Jets sample
     WJet  W+Jets sample
     DiB   WW,WZ,ZZ samples
     TTb   TTbar samples
     PJet  photon+Jet samples
     QCD   QCD samples
     ! pthat overlap removal for QCD/photon+Jets is not included in this macro.

   ps. the event wieght is calculated: cross-section / #total_unskimmed_event

   (2) run: root -b Run_ZgSelectorMC.C
       It will create a root file which save some information.
       You can change eleID/phoID/deltaR cut in Run_ZgSelectorMC.C
       For other cut, you can modify them in Zg_SelectorMC.C
       (search for "Set Cut")

   (3) Print out the event yield:
       run: root -b print_Event.C
       It will create a .txt file record the event yield information
       The input file is created by Run_ZgSelectorMC.C
       (You may need to modify the input file name)
       You can change luminosity in this file.
       ex. McLumi=30.

(B)Run on Data (Event Yield)
   (1) Modify the input dataset in ZgSelectData.h
   (2) run: root -b Run_ZgSelectData.C
       It will create a root file which save some information, and show all the Zgamma->eegamma candidates.
       You can change eleID/phoID/deltaR/Zmass cut in Run_ZgSelectorMC.C
       For other cut, you can modify them in ZgSelectData.C
       
(C)Make plots for MC/Data comparison
   run: root -b CombineHistogram.C
   You need the output file from Run_ZgSelectData.C and Run_ZgSelectorMC.C
   You also need to set the MC luminosity in CombineHistogram.C
   It will create a root file which save all comparison plot after each steps

(D)Index for eleID and photon ID:
   eleID:0-11:SimpleEidComIso60~95,SimpleEidrelIso60~95 (8:relIso80, 11:relIso95)
   phoID:0-8 :poter's95, 90, 85, 80, 75, 65, EG_Loose, EG_Tight, QCD photon

==============================================================================
For background estimation:(Not include ratio comparision between MC/data for now)
(A) root -b Run_ZgSelectData.C (Run on 38x EG data)
(B) root -b Run_ZgSelectorMC.C (only need Zgamma/Z+Jets samples)
(C) Go to RatioMethod direstory
(D) root -b RunGetRatio_Data.C 
    (Modified input files in GetRatio_Data.h, input are 38x JetMet data set)
    
(E) Modified input file name in plot_Ratio.C
    Search for Load File Name, modified "MCEvtYield, DataRatio, DataEvtYield"
    MCEvtYield   : the output of Run_ZgSelectorMC.C
    DataRatio    : the output of RunGetRatio_Data.C
    DataEvtYield : the output of Run_ZgSelectData.C
    
(F) root plot_Ratio.C

ps. please make sure the anti-selection for non-isolated photon, and the photon ID for iso-photon 
    are the same in those 3 macro:
    RunGetRatio_Data.C, Zg_SelectorMC and ZgSelectData.C
    The cut for non-isolated photon are:
    AntiUEB(anti-selection upper cut in EB),AntiUEE, AntiLEB(anti-selection lower cut in EB),AntiLEE
    The selection is AntiLEB < TrkIsoHollowDR04 - 0.001*pT < AntiUEB
    default is 3 < TrkIsoHollowDR04 - 0.001*pT < 999

ps. Better to use root 5.26
