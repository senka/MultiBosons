PHOSPHOR Correction
-------------------

The PHOSPHOR correction has been developed and tested in the CMSSW
package ElectroWeakAnalysis/MultiBosons but doesn't have any 
dependencies on CMSSW.  

There are several different ways of using it in your code 
standalone depending on how is your analysis setup.
You can compile it against a standalone executable with g++, you
can use it in CINT interpreted ROOT macro (although
it has to be first compiled with ACLiC) or you can use 
it with PyROOT.

Note that the compared to the current version v0.5 changed
the internal enum type PhosphorCorrectionFunctor::Mode 
used in the constructor. See the file testPhosphorCorrection.cc
for the list of supported modes and examples of usage.

v0.5 Release Notes
------------------
- Added corrections and smearings also for the 2011A+2011B average.

- Fixed a bug for pt < 10 GeV.  These photons are left uncorrected now.

- Merged standalone test and test in ROOT in a single file.

v0.4 Release Notes
------------------
- Added pt 10-12 and 20up categeories, so that the full
  pt range from 10 GeV is covered.

- Results are based on S6 Fall11 MC.

- The functor class derives from TObject and is a ROOT class
  for which the dictionary has to be generated.

v0.3 Release Notes
------------------
Fixed a bug of MC smearing when no gen-level match is found.  This is now
only corrected for the scale and no extra smearing is applied.

v0.2 Release Notes
------------------
MC can be smeared such that resolution matches 2011A or 2011B data.

v0.1 Release Notes
------------------
First implementation of the scale correction for both data and Monte Carlo.
